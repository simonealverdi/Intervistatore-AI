Hi!

Here you can see how the program has to be run the first time:
Python v 3.12 
1) Go to the directory of the back_end. 'cd ./BACK_END'
2) Install all the back_end's requirements:  'pip install -r requirements.txt' 

3) Open a new terminal and go to the directory of the front_end. 'cd ./FRONT_END'
4) Install all the front_end's requirements: 'setup.sh' or './setup.sh'
5) To start the front end: 'start.sh' or './start.sh'

6) To start the back_end go to the back_end's terminal. 'python -m uvicorn Main.main:app --reload'



To start the program in the next times:

1)Open two terminal. One for the back_end and oine for the front_end.
2)Go to the directories. (just like above)
3)back_end: 'python -m uvicorn Main.main:app --reload'
4)front_end: 'start.sh' or './start.sh'
